## Build Rmd Site from Vignettes

> Github action to build a Rmd site from an R package vignettes folder

It should have a valid `_site.yml` and `index.Rmd` file under `vignettes/` folder.

If it has a `_README.md` file in that same folder then it will render a github document and place it on the root folder.
